# Oikos

This is a project I worked on with a friend from the Business school. This is a website that would be used by real estate investors to evaluate properties and make data-driven decisions. The application will interface with an API provided by the City of Austin. To run the site on local machine, cd into the root directory and execute the following command:
```
npm run devStart
```
